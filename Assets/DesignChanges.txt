Alien Abduction â€“ Design Changes

Core concept kept:
- Endless rooftop runner where the player dodges UFO beam attacks.

Gameplay adjustments:
- Uses A and D for movement rather than arrow keys
- Buildings spawn infinitely with tuned gap and height limits.
- Added bounds so player doesn't go to far left or right.
- UFO cooldown reduced from 30s to ~6 seconds.
- Constantly tuned and adjusted player movements.

Art updates:
- Added parallax backgrounds (BG_Far, BG_Near).

Sound updates:
- SFX: jump, land, UFO warn, beam, game over.
- No background music to keep focus on SFX audio.

Code/Tech improvements:
- Scoring + Game Over UI.

Testing notes:
- No known gameplay bugs.
- Physics and collisions stable.
- Beware of Bounds.
- Tested on macOS with Unity 2022.3.17f1.
